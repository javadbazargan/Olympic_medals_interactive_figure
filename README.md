# Interactive dashboard visualizing Olympic data
I tried to provide an interactive bar chart showing Olympic medals hist had won by athletes which the both ‘countries’ and ‘sport disciplines’ can be selected form two checkboxes , furthermore the user can choose the type of medals .

Moreover I wanted to make a range slider to specify the time frame ((start year – end year) of period) that the plot figure changes accordingly .

## About dataset
* the datasets are in csv format and further information about them is accessible on link below :

* the column ‘slug_game’ in Olympic_medals dataset attributes to standardize sports content by events.
